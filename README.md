OpenStack Networks
==================

This role can be used to register networks, subnets and routers in neutron
using the os\_network, os\_subnet and os\_router modules.

Requirements
------------

The OpenStack neutron API should be accessible from the target host.

Role Variables
--------------

`os_networks_venv` is a path to a directory in which to create a virtualenv.

`os_networks_auth_type` is an authentication type compatible with the
`auth_type` argument of `os_*` Ansible modules.

`os_networks_auth` is a dict containing authentication information
compatible with the `auth` argument of `os_*` Ansible modules.

`os_networks_cacert` is an optional path to a CA certificate bundle.

`os_networks_cloud` is an optional name of a cloud in `clouds.yaml`.

`os_networks_interface` is the endpoint URL type to fetch from the service
catalog. Maybe be one of `public`, `admin`, or `internal`.

`os_networks` is a list of networks to register. Each item should be a
dict containing the following items:

- `name`: Name of the neutron network.
- `provider_network_type`: Provider type of the neutron network.
- `provider_physical_network`: Provider physical network of the neutron
  network.
- `provider_segmentation_id`: Provider segmentation ID of the neutron network.
- `shared`: Whether the neutron network is shared.
- `external`: Whether the neutron network is external.
- `project`: Optionally create this network for a project other than the
  authenticating project.
- `state`: Optional state of the network, default is `present`.
- `mtu`: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value to address fragmentation.
  Network will use OpenStack defaults if this option is not provided.
  Requires ansible >= 2.9.
- `port_security_enabled`: Whether port security is enabled on the network
  or not. Network will use OpenStack defaults if this option is not utilised.
  Boolean, true to enable, false otherwise. Requires ansible >= 2.8.
- `dns_domain`: The DNS domain value to set. Network will use Openstack
  defaults if this option is not provided. Requires ansible >= 2.9.
- `subnets`: A list of subnets to create in this network. Each item should
   be a dict containing the following items:
   - `name`: Name of the neutron subnet.
   - `cidr`: CIDR representation of the neutron subnet's IP network.
   - `dns_nameservers`: A list of DNS nameservers for the subnet.
   - `extra_specs`: Optional Dictionary with extra key/value pairs
     passed to the API. Requires ansible >= 2.7.
   - `gateway_ip`: IP address of the neutron subnet's gateway.
   - `no_gateway_ip`: Optional boolean, whether to omit a gateway IP. If unset,
     this will be `true` if `gateway_ip` is specified, and `false` otherwise.
   - `enable_dhcp`: Whether to enable DHCP on the subnet.
   - `allocation_pool_start`: Start of the neutron subnet's IP allocation
     pool.
   - `allocation_pool_end`: End of the neutron subnet's IP allocation pool.
   - `host_routes`: A list of classless static routes to supply to hosts
     connected to this subnet. A list of dicts of `destination`
     (destination network in CIDR encoding) and `nexthop`
     (router IP on this subnet) must be supplied.
   - `ip_version`: Optional IP version for the subnet.
   - `ipv6_address_mode`: Optional IPv6 address mode for the subnet.
   - `ipv6_ra_mode`: Optional IPv6 router advertisement mode for the subnet.
   - `use_default_subnetpool`: Optional boolean, whether to use the default
     subnet pool for the IP version.
   - `project`: Optionally create this subnet for a project other than the
     authenticating project.
   - `state`: Optional state of the subnet, default is `present`.

`os_networks_routers` is a list of routers to create. Each item should be a
dict containing the following items:

- `name`: Name of the neutron router.
- `interfaces`: List of names of subnets to attach to the router
  internal interface.
- `network`: Unique name or ID of the external gateway network.
- `external_fixed_ips`: Optional list of IP address parameters for the
  external gateway network. Each is a dictionary with the subnet name or
  subnet ID and the IP address to assign on the subnet.
- `project`: Optionally create this router for a project other than the
  authenticating project.
- `state`: Optional state of the router, default is `present`.


`os_networks_security_groups`: List of security groups to create.
Each item should be a dict containing the following items:
- `name`: Name of the security group.
- `description`: Optional description of the security group.
- `project`: Optional project in which to register the security group.
- `state`: Optional state of the security group, default is `present`.
- `rules`: Optional list of rules to add to the security group. Each item
  should be a dict containing the following items:
  - `direction`: Optional direction of the rule, default is `ingress`.
  - `ethertype`: Optional Ethertype of the rule, default is `IPv4`
  - `port_range_min`: Optional starting port.
  - `port_range_max`: Optional ending port.
  - `protocol`: Optional IP protocol of the rule.
  - `remote_group`: Optional name or ID of the security group to link.
  - `remote_ip_prefix`: Optional source IP address prefix in CIDR notation.
  - `state`: Optional state of the rule, default is `present`.

`os_networks_rbac` is a list of role-based access control
shares for named networks and projects.  See the [Neutron RBAC admin
guide](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-rbac.html#sharing-a-network-with-specific-projects)
for details. Each entry in the list is a dictionary containing the
following items:

- `network`: The name of the network to share. This network is normally
  owned by the `admin` project and not `shared` or `external`.
- `access`: The mode of sharing with the target project(s). Valid options
  are `access_as_external` and `access_as_shared`
- `projects`: A list of project names for sharing the named network
  in the designated way.

*NOTE*: RBAC assignments cannot be modified after they are created.

Dependencies
------------

This role depends on the `stackhpc.os_openstacksdk` role.

Example Playbook
----------------

The following playbook registers a neutron network, subnet and router.
A classless static route is defined to access another subnet through a
different gateway.
